## _[Where There's Smoke][0]_:

## Thomas Dunne Books, 1999\. A lovesick expatriate Cuban, an unscrupulous Southern capitalist, and a sanitized Mafia heir scratching a mid-life itch come together in this barbed tale centered around a cache of Cuban cigars secured for JFK just before he tightened the embargo in 1963\.
