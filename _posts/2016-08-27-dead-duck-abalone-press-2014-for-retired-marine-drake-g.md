### [Dead Duck][0]: 

### Abalone Press, 2014\. For retired marine Drake Green, the war might be over, but a new battle has only just begun.

### After returning from Vietnam to reclaim his ancestral land in Northern California, Green immediately locks horns with his wealthy neighbor, Armand Stilton III, an unscrupulous hunter who covets Green's land because of the natural gas underneath it.

### As Green scrambles to save his land from legal schemes launched by his money-hungry neighbor, his girlfriend's outlaw brother-in-law jumps in, fueling the conflict to a scorching climax.

### _Dead Duck_ is a compelling read, pitting Green, a heroic loner, against Stilton, an all powerful enemy whose limitless resources and ruthless greed clash at every level with all Green cherishes.

### Written in the spirit of Carl Hiaasen, Elmore Leonard, and Les Standiford, _Dead Duck_ is a nonstop thriller sure to appeal to outdoors people and fans of thriller mysteries.
